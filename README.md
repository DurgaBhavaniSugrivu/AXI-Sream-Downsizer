Highly Efficient Data Width Conversion Using AXI Stream Downsizer in Verilog

OVERVIEW

This project implements a high-performance AXI Stream Downsizer in Verilog for efficient data width conversion in FPGA/SoC designs. The module converts wide AXI-Stream input data into narrower output data streams while maintaining throughput and adhering to the AXI4-Stream protocol standards. This is useful in applications like data aggregation, memory interfaces, or heterogeneous bus communication where data widths between modules differ.
